# **App Name**: RAGStudio

## Core Features:

- Unified Dashboard: Dashboard provides a clear, multi-panel layout, inspired by MLflow, for managing RAG pipelines, displaying key performance metrics, and OpenSearch cluster monitoring data.
- Visual RAG Builder: GUI provides a drag-and-drop interface for visually composing LangGraph RAG components and RAG pipelines.
- AI-Powered RAG Configuration Tool: AI tool suggesting improvements to your RAG configurations.
- RAG Type Selection: Enable simple toggle between advanced GraphRAG (LangGraph) and naive RAG implementations.
- OpenSearch Integration: Integrates with OpenSearch to manage document embeddings, indexing, and retrieval processes.
- Performance Benchmarking: Testing compares performance metrics between RAG implementations (GraphRAG vs naive) to enhance optimization strategies.
- Contextual Navigation: Tabbed views switch between pipeline management, cluster/model/index/pipeline details, and performance monitoring sections.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#6366F1) evokes intelligence and clarity, crucial for a sophisticated RAG management platform.
- Background color: Light grey (#F9FAFB) provides a clean and neutral canvas.
- Accent color: Amber (#F59E0B) is used sparingly to highlight important actions and alerts, drawing attention effectively.
- Success color: Emerald (#10B981) represents completion and success for all operations in a visual and accessible way.
- Use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text and headings. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use 'JetBrains Mono' (monospace) for code snippets or when displaying OpenSearch queries. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Employs a multi-panel dashboard layout with a persistent sidebar for primary navigation, supplemented by tabbed interfaces for detailed RAG management.
- Utilizes a responsive grid system with a consistent 20px spacing to ensure adaptability and visual balance across different screen sizes.
